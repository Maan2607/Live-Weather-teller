# Live-Weather-teller
This project uses HTML, CSS and javascript to create a fully functional weather app using an API. We used OpenWeatherMap API in javascript to create a website that that displays the curent weather for any city.
Using Javascript 'fetch()' it dynamicaly modifies content on the page and background images.
